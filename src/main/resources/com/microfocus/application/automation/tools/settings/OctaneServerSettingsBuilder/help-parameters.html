                    This is usually done to add one more security layer. Some such servers might not allow receiving requests with encoded slashes (%2F).
                    As a job name might contain a slash, this parameter allows base64 encoding for job IDs during sending test results, build logs, coverage and vulnerabilities data to ALM Octane.
                    <br/>
